- Background color: A light purple (#F0E6F5), closely related to the primary, providing a gentle contrast and modern, on-trend look.

- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif, known for its geometric shapes that provide clarity on titles and subtitles. Body font: 'PT Sans', a warmer and legible font suitable for song lyrics and blocks of text. Together, the duo provides a friendly but modern UI
